How good can Quake get using just the standard assets ? That is a question I asked myself when I started this project. Starting from the existing Quake port for OSX done by fruitz-of-dojo, I want to see how much we can improve the Quake engine. This project is driven by the following aims:

  * Don't worry about backwards compatability with old hardware. I want to push new technologies, not spend time supporting legacy stuff.
  * Must be based on normal Quake assets - not extra packs like TenebraeQuake. This means we will also support all of the normal user-generated assets that work with the standard Quake engine.
  * Don't worry about non-OSX platforms - let someone else do that work if they want. This is an OSX project.
  * Focus on Cocoa and supporting tech. Carbon is dead baby.

Not only is this project a great opportunity to learn about a legendary 3D engine, it is also a chance to test out and learn new OSX technologies in a game based environment.
