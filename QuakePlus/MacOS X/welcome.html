Welcome to QuakePlus, a port of Quake for the Mac OSX platform. QuakePlus is based on the original Quake OSX port by fruitz-of-dojo, and many thanks goes out to Axel for all his original hard work.<p>
Where Axels port of Quake aims to preserve the original Quake in as much detail as possible, QuakePlus aims to take the original Quake engine to it's limits. It will use new hardware features and every technique possible to make Quake as good as possible. QuakePlus is not aimed at low end hardware, or legacy operating systems. The drive behind QuakePlus is to push Quake to the limit. QuakePlus is not aimed at being multi-platform either - it is an OSX product, and aims to capitalise on as much OSX technology as possible.<p>
Part of my reasons for starting this project was to give myself a large codebase with which to learn some OSX programming, and experiment with new technologies.
